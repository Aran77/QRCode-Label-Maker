# QR Code Label Maker

## The Problem
Our warehouse needed relabelling with modern QR codes for warehouse workers to confirm bin locations via a handheld android computer/scanner. We have 5,000 shelves to label!

## The Solution
A simple script to generate sequential warehouse labels with corresponding QR codes. Configured to produce a PDF file, save it and print.
